# CPCS324_PROJECT_PART1
Objective:

• Provide an opportunity to work with complex data structures 

• Develop advanced programming skills. 

Learning Outcomes:

• CLO #8: Compare select (covered) algorithms for the same problem. 

• CLO #9: Write code to implement select (covered) greedy algorithm(s) in programming language and environment of choice.

Given the following problem: 
“.. a problem like phone network design. You have a business with several offices; 
you want to lease phone lines to connect them up with each other, and the phone company 
charges different amounts of money to connect different pairs of cities. You want a set of 
lines that connects all your offices with a minimum total cost. It should be a spanning tree, 
since if a network isn’t a tree you can always remove some edges and save money.”
